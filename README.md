# HotDiceSimulatorV2
This is a basic simulator for the game "Hot Dice," also known as "Farkle." The program is currently capable of taking commandline input for player types and playing a game with those players, as well as running a series of test games to compute odds of winning using a particular strategy.

Note: This is my first project.
